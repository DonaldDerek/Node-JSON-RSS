It’s the simple approach that makes it highly recommendable; just log in with your old Google Reader account and all your feeds will return, shown in a modern, slick and picture centric view.

Its two column view is bare, yet shows all your updates in an easy to read manner. It has efficient keyboard shortcuts for power users and a nifty popular tab to see what other people are reading. If you’re a big fan of Instapaper, Digg could be the reader for you as both are operated by Betaworks so the integration is seamless.</p>\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href=\"http://digg.com/reader\">Digg Reader</a></p>\r\n\t\t</td>\n  \t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.t3me.com/sites/default/files/feature/2013/07/aol-reader-624.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.t3me.com/sites/default/files/feature/2013/07/aol-reader-624.jpg\" alt=\"3.

Again, it offers migration from your old accounts and a plethora of sharing options. Its interface is straightforward, with a list of feeds on the left and a picture based view of all your news to the right. As with the other readers, it’s simple and all about delivering and discovering content. Unfortunately app support is lacking and AOL says they have iOS and Android apps on the way, but for now the website displays well enough on mobile devices.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1 rtejustify\"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href=\"http://reader.aol.com/\">AOL Reader </a></p>\r\n<p class=\"lM tL nextPrompt rtejustify\"></p>\r\n\t\t</td>\n  \t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.t3me.com/sites/default/files/feature/2013/07/newsblur-624_0.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.t3me.com/sites/default/files/feature/2013/07/newsblur-624_0.jpg\" alt=\"4.

It focuses on delivering content quickly, updating your feeds every minute so you’re never out of the loop. You can view stories on their original site as well as sharing them with others. While it is free for up to 64 feeds, if you’re a power user it’s going to set you back $24 a year for more. It's not be pretty, but its power features are a definite plus.</p>\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a><br />\r\n\t<strong>Price</strong>: $24 a year (for more than 64 feeds)</p>\r\n\t\t</td>\n  \t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.t3me.com/sites/default/files/pulse-reader-624.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.t3me.com/sites/default/files/pulse-reader-624.jpg\" alt=\"5.

Big pictures are the name of the game, and Pulse puts striking images front and centre. The set up is easy too, enabling you to quickly populate your feeds with news topics such as sport or technology. Google Reader importing is also supported to make a pretty complete package, but probably one for the casual user.</p>\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Link</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.pulse.me/\">Pulse</a></p>\r\n\t\t</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n","summary":"\r\n\tDid the retirement of Google Reader leave you in a state of RSS blues?

Metro: Last Light takes off from where Metro 2033 left off, going beak, make that bleaker, with Communists, stranded subways and the odd Nazi. T3 Middle East spoke to Huw Beynon, Global Brand Manager for Metro Last Light on the development roadmap and The Art Of Apocalyptic Survival Horror Color Texturing.</h3>\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<p>Interview: Anil George, Support: Viva Entertainment</p>\r\n<p>a.</p>\r\n<p>What do you think differentiates Metro: Last Light from Metro 2033, and from the larger first-person shooter category games? The amazing graphics machine and far improved physics have been noted by many gamers.</p>\r\n<p>Well, there are two questions here!</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, we feel the Metro series is significantly removed from the vast majority of ‘shooters’ – and this is because our focus has always been on creating a rich, believable world, and providing the player with a deep, meaningful story as a way to explore that world.</p>\r\n<p>We don’t really class Metro as a ‘shooter’ – yes, it has combat elements, but as you have seen, there are large section of the game where you experience very different styles of gameplay, whether that be pure survival, horror, or exploration.</p>\r\n<p>So Metro is first and foremost a ‘1st person story’ that combines gameplay genres and styles that help tell that story.</p>\r\n<p>To the other part of your question – what differentiates Last Light from 2033 – this is a more subtle distinction, as we feel we got the basic&nbsp; formula right with Metro 2033. We didn’t want to change it fundamentally.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, we focused a lot on refining key ,mechanics – stealth, combat; improving our technology and visual fidelity; exploring a different set of narrative themes; and experimenting with a richer, more colourful palette and art style.</p>\r\n<p>b.</p>\r\n<p>Visually, how did you go about ensuring the sheer bleakness of the environment around the player. While Metro 2033 fell in a relatively straight forward post apocalyptic survival horror category , Last Light seems to be following a more fantasy horror theme….</p>\r\n<p>It’s amazing what a bit of colour can do J. Although we think the Russian setting, and the unique environment of the Metro helped us stand out from that ‘generic’ post-apocalyptic setting, we wanted to try something new for Last Light. I think Metro 2033 mostly avoided the ‘grey brown’ trap that is leveled at a lot of shooters / post-apocalyptic games due to our use of lighting, which gave us a lot of colour themes to add to the underground areas. However, the surface remained this uniformly bleak, desolate, ice-locked landscape full of blues, whites and greys. For Metro: Last Light we knew we didn’t want to just re-tread these environments – as artists, this is actually pretty boring. So we did a few things to change the look of the game, without losing that bleakness. Most important was moving the time frame of the story on a year – in this time, the nuclear winter has begun to thaw, and the first signs of spring are here. Our outdoor environments now have running water, the first signs of vegetation, sunlight breaking through the clouds. We also added day / night cycles and dramatic weather effects – thunder storms, rolling fog and cloud, howling winds blowing debris into your vision – these changes combined to give us a much richer and varied palette when building our outdoor environments, without losing that ‘bleakness’ that defines Metro.</p>\r\n<p>For our interiors, we use many more light sources, and more varied lights – from harsh white strip lights, to soft blue paraffin lamps, to the green glow of luminous fungus – all interplaying to create richer environments. And lastly, we thought a lot about location design – particularly our Station Cities. In D6, Venice and the Bolshoi Theater we created three very distinct environments, from each other and from any of the Stations of Metro 2033.</p>\r\n<p>c.</p>\r\n<p>When the game was originally shown at the 2011 E3 show, it was included in the Wii U show-reel, what were the issues faced in releasing the game on the Wii platform.</p>\r\n<p>It came down to time / resource – or rather a lack of the two. We are a small studio, and we are already trying to release the game on a new platform (PS3 – Metro 2033 was 360 and PC only).When it came to the crunch, we felt that dedicating staff to a Wii U version at the expense&nbsp; of PC, 360 and PS3 would be to the detriment of the overall quality of the product.</p>\r\n<p>We certainly didn’t mean to mislead anyone at E3 2011 – at that time we were a long way from launch, and it all seemed possible. There is certainly no technical reason why we could not get Metro to run on the platform, given some time and focus to take advantage of the hardware.</p>\r\n<p>d.</p>\r\n<p>A PlayStation 4 version of the game has been announced, what additions can we expect&nbsp; in the PS4 version of the game?</p>\r\n<p>Ha, it’s not quite announced! We expressed an interest in doing a PS4 version – and yes, we would still like to – but this has yet to be decided. We have no doubt we could easily produce a PS4 version, but it has to make sense commercially. Given we have already successfully released on current gen and PC, is there a big enough market left to justify the time and cost of development? Will people want an ‘old’ game for their ‘new’ PS4, or will they want a new title? Is it good enough to just release a ‘next gen’ version, or do we need to make significant improvements and add more content? These are all things we have to think about, and we do not have the answer yet sorry!</p>\r\n<p>e.</p>\r\n<p>One element that you have made clear is that the game will not ship with online mode, with a focus on the single player mode. Why was that stand taken, given the scope for enhanced exposure on an online mode option?</p>\r\n<p>Again, this was a really hard decision as we had spent some time&nbsp; prototyping a fully featured multiplayer component. We made the decision to cut it after E3 2013, when Metro had such a great response from the press and fans for its single player campaign. The choice was – continue with multiplayer, or bring that group back into the main team and focus everything on single player.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the community’s response, I think we made the right decision at the time – but it’s something we would like to return to. We hate to leave work unfinished.</p>\r\n<p>f.</p>\r\n<p>Tell us something on how you developed Artyom ‘s character. Compared to the person unsure of his path in 2033, he seems like a more confident explorer and fighter, is there a greater role in the pipeline for him?</p>\r\n<p>To put it simply, in Metro 2033 Artyom was a ‘boy’ (okay, we was in his early&nbsp; 20’s but he was young, naïve and lived a sheltered life). Metro 2033 was the story of his journey to manhood, his loss of innocence. In Metro: Last Light, Artyom is a man -&nbsp; jaded, burnt out, and guilty of genocide against the Dark Ones. His story is now one of salvation, redemption… Can he return to innocence? Through the player’s actions, and the way you play as Artyom, that question is answered.</p>\r\n<p>g.</p>\r\n<p>Despite being a linear shooter, Metro: Last Light is a systemic game. We specifically loved the concept of a button mapped specifically for the sole purpose of wiping your face….</p>\r\n<p>And that is just one example! Yes, we wanted to give the player a huge range of controls and actions, far more than you might expect in a straight ‘shooter’ – although as we have said, we think Metro is more than just a shooter! The ability to wipe your mask is, I think, symbolic of our approach to design. It may seem like a small detail, but the cumulative effect of these details is what makes Metro such an immersive whole.</p>\r\n<p>h.</p>\r\n<p>The storyline, in contrast to the environs is very imaginative, with its blend of Nazis, the Communists and the Order. What were the factors you considered while putting together this story structure?</p>\r\n<p>The storyline, we really have Dmitry Glukhovsky to thank for. The balance of power between the warring extremist factions is a theme that runs through both Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light – it’s Dmitry’s pessimistic (but arguably realistic) metaphor for the nature of mankind, as well as a thinly veiled parable for the contemporary&nbsp; social and political landscape. That injection of social realism into the storytelling gives us a more believable world than standard post-apocalyptic mythology.</p>\r\n<p>i.</p>\r\n<p>Dmitry Glukhovsky was working deeply with you on the game, what unique element do you think he brought to the game, in terms of characterization, gameplay aspects etc?</p>\r\n<p>Dmitry contributed the key plotline and narrative themes, character studies and character development and the vast majority of actual dialogue, including all the side conversations that do so much to flesh out the game world. Actual scenario and gameplay design was handled by the studio. Having a master story teller like Dmitry involved really helped us elevate the narrative elements of the game, allowing 4A to focus on gameplay.</p>\r\n<p>j.</p>\r\n<p>What is the future of the console, how do you see social networks playing a part of the gaming sphere? Do you think it’s possible to have the same impact as purely console based games? Say, for the ipad or for Android?</p>\r\n<p>All game-playing devices – PC, console, tablet and mobile – serve the needs of the gaming audience. Some game types are (currently) a naturally better fit for high power, high fidelity consoles and PC.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, we will see social and connected features continue to transform console games as they have mobile, but as long as there is an audience for the kind of epic, long-form single player adventure that the console experience can deliver, you will continue to see games like Metro: Last Light being made!</p>\r\n<p>k.</p>\r\n<p>How far are we from putting a player bang in the middle of the action, as a virtual cast member</p>\r\n<p>Doesn’t that already happen? Look at the MMO space, with games like EVE…</p>\r\n<p>l.</p>\r\n<p>Who is your gaming idol, someone whom you have idolized.

True, this pixel-jammed monster machine was highlighted at CES as well, where it bested the other me-too-4k’ers by quite a bit.</p>\r\n<p>Reports say the brand has manufactured only 77 units for a select batch of customers. Design-wise, the S9 is quite a piece of work, being virtually bezel-free with the display being housed in what Samsung call a Timeless Gallery frame, making the TV \"appear to be floating within its frame – and showcases the juxtaposition of a minimalist concept with such a large display.\"&nbsp; The Samsung S9 has a quad-core processor, Precision Black Pro technology to deliver deep, real blacks. Voice and gesture control are obviously part and parcel of the experience.

Features include an ultra-thin profile, quarter-inch thick bezel and a wave-inspired Arc stand making the television appear as though it's floating in the air.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also a first in its line-up is the 85-inch Ultra High Definition TV, or UHD TV, the 85S9. It features a complete boarder called the Timeless Gallery design, also making it appear as though it is floating. The 85S9 is Ultra HD, Samsung's way of saying 4K - four times the resolution of Full HD displays. Embedded is also a display converter than can take HD and Full HD content and automatically upscale it to UHD resolution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also big news for 2013, and seen at CES, is the Evolution Kit, capable of breathing in fresh life to your older Smart TV models. Add the Evolution Kit and immediately access the latest Smart TV offerings including quad-core power and the new Smart Hub.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Smart Hub</strong></p>\r\n<p>A new Smart Hub has also been introduced within 2013 Smart TV models. The new update brings a complete redesign, intelligently organizing a user's content into clear menu panels for simple and intuitive viewing. The three new panels include Apps, Photos, Videos &amp; Music, and Social.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Home Theater&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The HT-F9750W is Samsung's latest in home theater technology - a 1,330-watt sound system from four speaker towers, and a central speaker. New for the year is the addition of Samsung's Gallium Nitride amplifier, paired with last year's vacuum tube to create pure and natural sound.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The HW-F751 is Samsung's second home theater product, the AirTrack, a sound bar that can connect with a TV via Bluetooth and doubles as a wireless speaker for your smartphone or tablet.

That's how we became massive fans of The Entertainer which was launched recently in Lebanon.</h3>\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<p>For those of you who haven't heard of The Entertainer, first of all, we salute you for finally crawling from under that proverbial rock. Briefly, The Entertainer is a wildly successful Coupon Book that was first launched in Dubai, later expanding to 17 countries and 21 versions.</p>\r\n<p>Last week ,The Entertainer's \"Beirut version\" was launched in the swish Le Gray hotel in downtown Beirut, and T3 editors got a piece of the action.</p>\r\n<p>The Entertainer is basically a \"buy one get one free\" passport to more than 200 merchant partners in Lebanon. This includes Lebanon’s trendiest restos, pubs, lounges, fine diners, casual restaurants, nightspots, cafes, leisure activities, as well as spas, resorts and hotels.</p>\r\n<p>You get 3 coupons per merchant. So let's say you wanted to treat the special lady/man of your life to a tasty Sushi meal fit for a Japanese emperor. Open your Entertainer book, pick your spot (say the posh Yabani Sushi joint). You go there, pick a main course meal and the coupon in your pocket will make sure your escort will get something for the same value (or less) for nada (as in gratis, free, for nothing).</p>\r\n<p>Better yet, should you decide to split the bill (yes, it's ok to do that), that means you both just received a gourmet meal for 25% or its original value. That's 75% of the cost of an expensive day out saved towards getting that shiny new <a href=\"http://t3me.com/category/free-tags/galaxy-s4\">Galaxy S4</a> / <a href=\"http://t3me.com/category/free-tags/htc-one\">HTC One</a> / <a href=\"http://www.t3me.com/category/story-stream/iphone-5s\">iPhone 5S</a>.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose to visit the partner multiple times or include your family and friends in the 2 for 1 fun! For instance, why not use 3 coupons to invite 5 of your friends to a night out where everything costs half. That will make them remember your birthday (or get you something other than cheap mugs).</p>\r\n<p>By buying the Entertainer (80$ / 120000 LBP, or 108,000LBP if you purchase it online), you'll also receive a hotel suplement offering you a free night for every night purchased in a network of international hotels (not just in Beirut).

Even though its release date is set to be in July, Blackberry made an exception with the opening of its new retail store in the United Arab Emirates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough the phone is said to be priced in a more inexpensive range, direct currency conversions may be a tad unreliable seeing as how the phone could be priced at a higher price than expected. Blackberry loyalists may still find it to be cheaper than its BB smartphone counterparts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the UAE, in particular, the phone (SIM-free) is at an estimated cost of $408.

This phone has great memory space with 2GB of RAM, not to mention its 4G LTE connectivity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo is that trip to Dubai still appealing or do you prefer to wait for the West to launch the Q5?
